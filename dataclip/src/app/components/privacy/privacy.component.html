      <p class="mt-4">
        This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their "Personally
        Identifiable Information" (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information
        security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a
        single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read this privacy policy carefully to get a clear
        understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in
        accordance with our website.
      </p>
      <br>


      <h4 class="font-weight-bold">When do we collect information?</h4>
      <br>
      <p>Dataclip provides a data collection service for websites. As such we may collect information from two groups of
        people:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>People who register for a Dataclip account.</li>
        <li>People who interact with the websites that use the Dataclip service.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Information you provide to us (name, email, other contact information) is collected at the time you provide said
        information. e.g. when you sign up for an account, or submit a Dataclip form on a another website. Other
        information such as website usage may be collected when you interact with the Dataclip website.
      </p>
      <br>


      <h4 class="font-weight-bold">What information does Dataclip collect?</h4>
      <br>
      <p>The data we collect depends on your interactions with Dataclip.</p>

      </p>
      <br>

      <h4 class="font-weight-bold">How do we use your information?</h4>
      <br>
      <p>We may use the information we collect from you when you register, purchase an account, sign up for our
        newsletter, respond to a survey or marketing communication, browse the website, or use certain other site
        features in the following ways:</p>
      <ul>

          you are most interested.
        </li>
        <li>To send periodic emails regarding your account or other products and services.</li>
        <li>To improve the web service.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <p>Data is stored is secure servers managed by AWS in the United States.</p>
      <br>

      <h4 class="font-weight-bold">How do we protect your information?</h4>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Our website is scanned on a regular basis for security holes and known vulnerabilities in order to make your
          visit to our site as safe as possible.
        </li>
        <li>Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of
          persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.
          In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
          technology.
        </li>
        <li>We implement a variety of security measures when a user purchases an account, enters, submits, or accesses
          their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.
        Payhere is the provider for purchases through the Dataclip website.</p>
      <br>

      <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Do we use "cookies"?</h4>
      <br>
      <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive
        through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your
        browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to implement logins. We also
        use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer
        better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>
      <p>We use cookies to understand and save user's preferences for future visits. We use cookies to keep a user
        logged in to Dataclip between page refreshes.</p>
      <p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off
        all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different; look at your
        browser's Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p>
      <p>If you turn cookies off, some of the features of Dataclip, such logging in and signing up, will not function
        properly.</p>
      <br>

      <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Third-party disclosure</h4>
      <br>
      <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information unless
        we provide users with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who
        assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties
        agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release information when it's release is appropriate to
        comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property or safety.</p>
      <p>However, anonymous, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for
        marketing or advertising uses.</p>
      <br>

      <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Third-party links</h4>
      <br>
      <p>We do not include or offer third-party products or services on our website.</p>
      <br>

      <h4 class="font-weight-bold">California Online Privacy Protection Act</h4>
      <br>
      <p>California is the first state in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a
        privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United
        States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from
        California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being
        collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. See more at:
        <a target="_blank"
           href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a>
      </p>
      <p>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users can visit our site anonymously.</li>
        <li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our homepage or as a minimum, on the first
          significant page after entering our website.
        </li>
        <li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.
        </li>
        <li>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page</li>
        <li>You can change your personal information
          <ul>
            <li>By logging in to your account</li>
            <li>By chatting with us or by sending us a support <a href="mailto:info@dataclip.tech">email</a></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <h4 class="font-weight-bold">How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</h4>
      <br>
      <p>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT)
        browser mechanism is in place.</p>
      <br>

      <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h4>
      <br>
      <p>It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking.</p>
      <br>

      <h4 class="font-weight-bold">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h4>
      <br>
      <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the
        Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United
        States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and
        online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>
      <p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>
      <br>

      <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Fair Information Practices</h4>
      <br>
      <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the
        concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
        globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to
        comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
      <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a
        data breach occur:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We will notify you via email within 1 business day</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally
        pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle
        requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have
        recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
      <br>

      <h4 class="font-weight-bold">CAN SPAM Act</h4>
      <br>
      <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial
        messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough
        penalties for violations.</p>
      <p>We collect your email address in order to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.</li>
        <li>Send you additional information related to your product and/or service</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
        <li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li>
        <li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</li>
        <li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li>
        <li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</li>
        <li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at
        <a href="mailto:info@dataclip.tech">info@dataclip.tech</a> or follow the instructions at the bottom of each
        email and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.</p>
